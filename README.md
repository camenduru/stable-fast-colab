## Introduction

This is a Colab for running `StableDiffusionPipeline` with [`stable-fast`](https://github.com/chengzeyi/stable-fast) inference acceleration.
`stable-fast` is one of the fastest inference acceleration frameworks for `diffusers`.
It acheieves best performance with newer GPUs.
On Colab __T4__, it can also speedup the image generation significantly, but won't be as fast as with __A100__ or __4090__.
